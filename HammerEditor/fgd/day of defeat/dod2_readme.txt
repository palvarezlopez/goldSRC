Unzip this file in your worldcraft folder, and make sure you 
have winzip keep folder names (so the sprites get installed 
properly).

Then go into WorldCraft and set up the FGD included as your only
DoD FGD.

Note:  This is a PRELIMINARY FGD and things MAY change before
the final release.  Use with caution!
